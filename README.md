# EduGame

EduGame is an engaging learning platform designed to make algorithmic learning enjoyable and interactive. This project is tailored for beginners and new learners, providing a hands-on experience with algorithm visualization and problem-solving. The goal is to improve algorithm processing skills through a gamified structure.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can sign up or sign in to access the game.
- Progressive Levels: Start from basic algorithm concepts and gradually tackle more complex problems.
- Algorithm Visualization: Visualize how different algorithms work step by step.
- Interactive Questions: Answer algorithm-based questions to proceed to the next level.
- Scoring System: Earn points for each correct answer and track your total score.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Topological Sorting
4. Strongly Connected Components
5. Shortest Path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)
6. Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s Algorithm)
7. Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s Algorithm)

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: C++
- Graphics Library: `graphics.h` for algorithm visualization

## How to Play
1. Sign Up/Sign In: Create an account or log in to start.
2. Begin the Game: Start at level 1, where you'll learn and answer questions based on simple algorithms.
3. Progress Through Levels: Solve questions correctly to unlock higher levels with more complex algorithms.
4. Score Points: Earn points for correct answers, and see your total score at the end.
